1.  Introduction

   We propose the Opus codec based on a linear prediction layer (LP) and
   an MDCT-based enhancement layer.  The main idea behind the proposal
   is that the speech low frequencies are usually more efficiently coded
   using linear prediction codecs (such as CELP variants), while the
   higher frequencies are more efficiently coded in the transform domain
   (e.g.  MDCT).  For low sampling rates, the MDCT layer is not useful
   and only the LP-based layer is used.  On the other hand, non-speech
   signals are not always adequately coded using linear prediction, so
   for music only the MDCT-based layer is used.

   In this proposed prototype, the LP layer is based on the SILK [1]
   codec [SILK] and the MDCT layer is based on the CELT [2] codec
   [CELT].

   This is a work in progress.

2.  Opus Codec

   In hybrid mode, each frame is coded first by the LP layer and then by
   the MDCT layer.  In the current prototype, the cutoff frequency is 8
   kHz.  In the MDCT layer, all bands below 8 kHz are discarded, such
   that there is no coding redundancy between the two layers.  Also both
   layers use the same instance of the range coder to encode the signal,
   which ensures that no "padding bits" are wasted.  The hybrid approach
   makes it easy to support both constant bit-rate (CBR) and varaible
   bit-rate (VBR) coding.  Although the SILK layer used is VBR, it is
   easy to make the bit allocation of the CELT layer produce a final
   stream that is CBR by using all the bits left unused by the SILK
   layer.

   The implementation of SILK-based LP layer is similar to the
   description in the SILK Internet-Draft [SILK] with the main exception
   that SILK was modified to use the same range coder as CELT.  The
   implementation of the CELT-based MDCT layer is available from the
   CELT website and is a more recent version (0.8.1) of the CELT
   Internet-Draft [CELT].  The main changes include better support for
   20 ms frames as well as the ability to encode only the higher bands
   using a range coder partially filled by the SILK layer.

   In addition to their frame size, the SILK and CELT codecs require a
   look-ahead of 5.2 ms and 2.5 ms, respectively.  SILK's look-ahead is
   due to noise shaping estimation (5 ms) and the internal resampling
   (0.2 ms), while CELT's look-ahead is due to the overlapping MDCT
   windows.  To compensate for the difference, the CELT encoder input is
   delayed by 2.7 ms.  This ensures that low frequencies and high
   frequencies arrive at the same time.

2.1.  Source Code

   The source code is currently available in a Git repository [3] which
   references two other repositories (for SILK and CELT).  Some
   snapshots are provided for convenience at
   <http://people.xiph.org/~jm/ietfcodec/> along with sample files.
   Although the build system is very primitive, some instructions are
   provided in the toplevel README file.  This is very early development
   so both the quality and feature set should greatly improve over time.
   In the current version, only 48 kHz audio is supported, but support
   for all configurations listed in Section 3 is planned.

3.  Codec Modes

   There are three possible operating modes for the proposed prototype:

   1.  A linear prediction (LP) mode for use in low bit-rate connections
       with up to 8 kHz audio bandwidth (16 kHz sampling rate)

   2.  A hybrid (LP+MDCT) mode for full-bandwidth speech at medium
       bitrates

   3.  An MDCT-only mode for very low delay speech transmission as well
       as music transmission.

   Each of these modes supports a number of difference frame sizes and
   sampling rates.  In order to distinguish between the various modes
   and configurations, we need to define a simple header that can used
   in the transport layer (e.g RTP) to signal this information.  The
   following describes the proposed header.

   The LP mode supports the following configurations (numbered from
   00000...01011 in binary):

   o  8 kHz: 10, 20, 40, 60 ms (00000...00011)

   o  12 kHz: 10, 20, 40, 60 ms (00100...00111)

   o  16 kHz: 10, 20, 40, 60 ms (01000...01011)

   for a total of 12 configurations.

   The hybrid mode supports the following configurations (numbered from
   01100...01111):

   o  32 kHz: 10, 20 ms (01100...01101)

   o  48 kHz: 10, 20 ms (01110...01111)

   for a total of 4 configurations.

   The MDCT-only mode supports the following configurations (numbered
   from 10000...11101):

   o  8 kHz: 2.5, 5, 10, 20 ms (10000...10011)

   o  16 kHz: 2.5, 5, 10, 20 ms (10100...10111)

   o  32 kHz: 2.5, 5, 10, 20 ms (11000...11011)

   o  48 kHz: 2.5, 5, 10, 20 ms (11100...11111)

   for a total of 16 configurations.

   There is thus a total of 32 configurations, so 5 bits are necessary
   to indicate the mode, frame size and sampling rate (MFS).  This
   leaves 3 bits for the number of frames per packets (codes 0 to 7):

   o  0-2: 1-3 frames in the packet, each with equal compressed size

   o  3: arbitrary number of frames in the packet, each with equal
      compressed size (one size needs to be encoded)

   o  4-5: 2-3 frames in the packet, with different compressed sizes,
      which need to be encoded (except the last one)

   o  6: arbitrary number of frames in the packet, with different
      compressed sizes, each of which needs to be encoded

   o  7: The first frame has this MFS, but others have different MFS.
      Each compressed size needs to be encoded.

   When code 7 is used and the last frames of a packet have the same
   MFS, it is allowed to switch to another code for them.

   The compressed size of the frames (if needed) is indicated -- usually
   -- with one byte, with the following meaning:

   o  0: No frame (DTX or lost packet)

   o  1-251: Size of the frame in bytes

   o  252-255: A second byte is needed.  The total size is (size[1]*4)+
      (size[0]%4)+252

   The maximum size representable is 255*4+3+252=1275 bytes.  For 20 ms
   frames, that represents a bit-rate of 510 kb/s, which is really the
   highest rate anyone would want to use in stereo mode (beyond that
   point, lossless codecs would be more appropriate).

4.  Security Considerations

   The codec needs to take appropriate security considerations into
   account, as outlined in [DOS] and [SECGUIDE].  It is extremely
   important for the decoder to be robust against malicious payloads.
   Malicious payloads must not cause the decoder to overrun its
   allocated memory or to take much more resources to decode.  Although
   problems in encoders are typically rarer, the same applies to the
   encoder.  Malicious audio stream must not cause the encoder to
   misbehave because this would allow an attacker to attack transcoding
   gateways.

   In its current version, the Opus codec likely does NOT meet these
   security considerations, so it should be used with caution.
